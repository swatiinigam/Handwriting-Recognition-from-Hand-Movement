# Handwriting-Recognition-from-Hand-Movement
Handwriting Recognition Using Hand Tracking

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand movements and enable handwriting recognition using a webcam. You can write on a virtual canvas by pinching your thumb and index finger together, creating an air-pen effect.

Features

✅ Hand Tracking: Detects and tracks your hand using a webcam.
✅ Air Writing: Draws on the screen when you pinch your fingers together.
✅ Smooth Writing: Reduces shaky movements for smoother handwriting.
✅ Real-Time Visualization: Displays both the live camera feed and the handwriting output.
✅ Keyboard Controls:

Press 'c' → Clears the screen.

Press 's' → Saves the handwriting as an image.

Press 'q' → Exits the program.
How It Works

1️⃣ Open the program and allow webcam access.
2️⃣ Move your hand in front of the camera.
3️⃣ Pinch your thumb and index finger together to start writing.
4️⃣ Move your hand smoothly to write on the screen.
5️⃣ Release your fingers to stop writing.
6️⃣ Use keyboard shortcuts to clear (c), save (s), or quit (q).
